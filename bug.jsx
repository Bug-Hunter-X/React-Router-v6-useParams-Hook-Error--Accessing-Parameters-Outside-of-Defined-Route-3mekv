In React Router Dom v6, a common error occurs when using the `useParams` hook within a component that's not nested within a route that matches the parameters.  This typically happens when the route structure doesn't align with how the component is being rendered.

For example:

```jsx
// Incorrect usage
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  const { id } = useParams();
  // ...
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MyComponent />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this case, `MyComponent` attempts to access parameters without being nested within a route like `/users/:id`.  This will result in an error because `useParams` will return `undefined` for all parameters.
